Hello,
I'm a Front End developer, based in Portugal. 

In 2021 I decided to change my career and the first step was entering World Academy school. I focused myself in web development and learned to efficiently build responsive pages and apps for the web with HTML, Css, Javascript, React, and React Native. 

Tech industry gives me the chance to unleash the creative spirit I developed during my years as a photographer. 
I am always looking forward to learn and master skills in Front End and Ux/Ui. 

If you realize that I would be a good fit, drop me a message.
